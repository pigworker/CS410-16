being the lecture materials and exercises for the 2016/17 session of Advanced Functional Programming at Strathclyde

## How to use this repo

Students, please clone this repository and maintain your own version.

Much of the teaching will involve live-coding in class. The files we generate that way will end up here. Pull requests are welcome, especially to record comments. If there's a remark which helps the code make sense, share it!

Also, the initial state of the exercises will be delivered via this repo. You will each get a departmental GitLab account where you can commit (frequently!) your work towards the solution of the exercises. The class staff will have access to your individual repos and use that to communicate feedback and scores for your code. Often, this will happen in person: we'll have a chat whilst marking and record the key points in your file as we go.

## Assessment

This class is 100% by coursework, based on five hand-ins with oral and written feedback. Your best four hand-ins will each contribute 25% to your score. Deadlines for exercises are as follows

  1. Friday     7 October
  2. Friday    28 October
  3. Friday    18 November
  4. Wednesday 11 January
  5. as late in May as we can get away with and still return a final mark to the exam board (to be announced)
